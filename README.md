# Project Aims:
The aim of this project is to demonstrate basic JDBC database connectivity, enabling a user via a basic interface (developed using JavaFx) to peform CRUD operations.
The project is complete in that it:
### Current Features:
* Opens a user interface offering easier engagement with the database
* View data in the database table
* Create (insert) new data into the database table
* Modify existing data in the database table
* Delete existing data in the database table
### Potential updates:
* Create a properties file to load database configuration settings from
* Create a dynamic system to automatically gather column names, reducing hardcoded reliance on specific columns
* Add additional validation techniques to verify data is correct (i.e., does the length of the String match the database schema)
* Add a logging system that logs data to a file in how the database is operating
* Improve the user interface to be more stylish
* Add further SQL techniques to sanitise data and protect against SQL injection
* Add a database script to allow the database to be created via applications such as HeidiSQL
### Notes:
* This project is currently designed to be a basic demonstration of using a simple interface to engage with basic CRUD operations. It lacks key security concerns, some of which are outlined in the Potential Updates section. As a demo application, I believe it achieves the purposes laid out whilst also seeing areas of improvement.
